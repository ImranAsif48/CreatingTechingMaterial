## Importing Lab Exercise into Eclipse with GitLab
1. Importing repository from GitLab to Eclipse. See [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/fba33dae-0508-4c30-9382-9561d18ea802)
1. The lab projects contain all task files for that lab, including instructions in the README file
1. When you complete a task, commit your changes and push these back to the GitLab server (See [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a332d698-37b9-47f1-84aa-c750e7f1e1bd). This will run integration tests which will allow you to verify how your work is going
